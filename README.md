## Overview

This is the very first challenge I've finished on Frontend Mentor. Through this challenge, I learnt how to make a QR component by using a card. I use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4 in order to achieve the most accurate visual.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I started by writing down the HTML first to give this page a structure. Then Boostratp 4 was added shortly after. But most of the components was styled by using CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstratp 4

### What I learned
